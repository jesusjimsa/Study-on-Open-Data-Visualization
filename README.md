# Study on Open Data Visualization

Considering at least 3 public datasets, design and implement minimum 5 different data visualization solutions for each selected dataset. These proposals will be available as responsive Web applications. Discuss and compare various alternatives regarding proper data visualizations according to the existing usability principles.  

Deliverables:

- a technical report – available in Scholarly HTML format; the content will be equivalent to a document of 12—14 standard A4 pages
- a public GitHub repository of the original source-code examples available under an open source license
- a public Website providing the interactive demos for all data visualization solutions.  

All Python scripts are writen to export data to csv files (mainly). You can change it to json by comenting the lines that use the function `write` and removing the comments that use the `json.dump...` function.
